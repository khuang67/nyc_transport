project title: NYC Transportation Barriers Research Project


project description: 
This project analyzes user experience barriers in NYC's multi-modal transportation system using data from the 2019 Citywide Mobility Survey. Through spatial and temporal analysis of over 85,000 trip records, the research examines how journey characteristics vary across different NYC zones, identifies key movement corridors and connectivity gaps, analyzes transportation mode distribution by neighborhood, and investigates how multi-modal integration works in practice. The project creates visualizations revealing the complex relationships between location, transportation modes, and accessibility to highlight areas where interventions could improve mobility across the five boroughs.


rationale statement: 
The project was motivated by personal experiences navigating between different transit options during daily commutes from Brooklyn to Manhattan. These experiences highlighted how transportation challenges vary dramatically depending on neighborhood, time of day, and weather conditions. The stark disparities in mobility experiences across NYC neighborhoods create inequitable access to opportunities, with some residents paying a daily "time tax" for living in poorly connected areas. By understanding the geographic, modal, and temporal patterns that create barriers to efficient mobility, this research aims to identify where targeted interventions could create more inclusive transportation solutions.
